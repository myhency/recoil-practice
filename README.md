# Excalidraw Clone built with Recoil

This is the start of an [Exaclidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) clone that I am building with [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).

It is for my **upcoming free Recoil course**, [Learn Recoil](https://learnrecoil.com/), where I will show you how to build a **full featured Excalidraw clone using Recoil** for state management.

## What you'll learn to build in the course (on top of what's already in this repo)...

-   🔄 Rotating shapes
-   ✌️ Multi-select
-   🔵 More kinds of shapes
-   💾 Saving a drawing to a file and opening it again
-   🌍 Saving the drawing to a server (shareable drawing URL)
-   🌄 Loading content (e.g. images) from an API with Recoil and Suspense
-   👯‍♂️ Enabling concurrent mode
-   🧪 Adding full test coverage
-   🤔 Your own dev tools for debugging
-   🔑 Authentication
-   🏃 Performance debugging, testing, and improvement
-   And more...
